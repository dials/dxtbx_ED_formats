"""Implementation of a format class for images recorded on a TVIPS TemCam-F416
and converted to SMV by img2px, part of the tvips-tools-jiffies package.
This is intended specifically for processing of the Trypsin datasets available
at https://data.sbgrid.org/dataset/288/, but could be adapted for other
datasets produced in a similar manner."""
